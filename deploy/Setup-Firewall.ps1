.SYNOPSIS
  Restrict inbound access to cluster-payout-optimization's port to the
  Tailscale network only (plus localhost). Run ONCE as Administrator, after
  Tailscale is installed and running.

.DESCRIPTION
  Adds a Windows Firewall inbound ALLOW rule scoped to the Tailscale CGNAT
  range (100.64.0.0/10) and localhost, for TCP port 8502. Because Windows
  Firewall's default inbound policy is "Block" for anything not explicitly
  allowed, and this script does NOT add a broad allow rule, devices on your
  regular LAN/Wi-Fi (not on the tailnet) cannot reach the app even though it
  listens on 0.0.0.0. Combine this with Tailscale ACLs (in the Tailscale
  admin console) to control which specific tailnet devices/users may connect.
